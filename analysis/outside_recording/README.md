# Data Collection from outside the ZT building
This was done to try and determine the influence of other EMR on our CSI data.

## WiFi Signal Presence
To try and quantify the difference in WiFi activity (there might be more radiation in the same frequency that is not WiFi, e.g. Bluetooth, Zigbee, ...) we performed a scan of nearby WiFi networks at the outside measurement location.

This data can then be compared with the scan from within the building to see whether the amount of ambient signals could be reduced by this test.
